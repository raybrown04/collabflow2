# CollabFlow Project Status Report

## Global Project Status

Significant progress has been made. The **User Management & Authentication** foundation is complete, including successful client-side Firebase initialization. The **Project Management Basics** feature set (Firestore schema, rules, Cloud Functions, frontend integration) is implemented. The Unified Workspace Dashboard UI structure is functional, displaying projects and placeholders. Estimated completion: ~40%.

## Completed

*   Initial Next.js project structure using TypeScript.
*   Basic Firebase project configuration (`firebase.json`).
*   UI component library setup (using shadcn/ui components found in `src/components/ui`).
*   Basic application layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`).
*   Directory structure and placeholders for AI features and service integrations.
*   Initial documentation (`docs/blueprint.md`).
*   **Firebase Client-Side Configuration (`.env.local`)**: Created and populated with necessary API keys and config values, verifying successful Firebase initialization in the frontend app.
*   **Firebase Authentication flows (`/src/lib/auth.ts`)**: Implemented setup for Google, Microsoft, Apple sign-in providers, sign-out, `useAuth` hook. Added cross-platform compatibility notes.
*   **Firestore Schema (`@docs/firestoreSchema.md`)**: Defined schema for `users`, `invites`, and **`projects`** collections. Placeholders remain for tasks and integrations.
*   **Invite-Only System Logic**:
    *   Cloud Function (`/functions/invite.js`) implemented for `createInvite` and `verifyAndAcceptInvite` using **Firebase Admin SDK**.
    *   Cloud Functions dependencies defined in `/functions/package.json` (including `uuid`).
    *   Frontend helper functions (`/src/lib/invite.ts`) for calling invite functions.
*   **Firestore Security Rules (`/firestore.rules`)**: Implemented rules for `users`, `invites`, and **`projects`**, enforcing role-based access. Placeholder rules added for related data.
*   **Deployment Documentation (`@docs/deployment.md`)**: Updated with instructions for deploying Cloud Functions and Firestore rules.
*   **Project Management Basics**:
    *   Cloud Function (`/functions/projects.js`) implemented for `createProject`, `getProjects`, `updateProject`, `deleteProject` with admin restrictions.
    *   Frontend helper functions and hook (`/src/lib/projects.ts`) created for interacting with project functions, including improved error handling (`ProjectError`).
*   **Unified Workspace Dashboard UI (`/src/components/dashboard.tsx`, `/src/app/page.tsx`)**:
    *   Implemented basic dashboard structure using shadcn/ui components.
    *   Integrated project list using `useProjects` hook with loading (skeleton) and error states.
    *   Included placeholder widgets and corrected icon usage.
    *   Applied basic styling and added `framer-motion` for animations.

## In Progress

*   **Refinement of Dashboard UI**: Enhancing widget appearance, responsiveness, and animations.
*   **Firestore Triggers (Optional but Recommended)**: Implementing triggers to synchronize `assignedProjects` in `users` with `members` in `projects`.
*   **Error Handling & User Feedback**: Improving user feedback mechanisms for CRUD operations.
*   **Testing**: Adding unit/integration tests for Cloud Functions and frontend components.

## Next Steps

Based on the requirements in `@blueprint.md` and current progress, the next priorities are:

1.  **Calendar Management Integration**:
    *   Implement backend logic (Cloud Functions) for Google/Microsoft Calendar APIs.
    *   Implement frontend service logic (`src/services/`).
    *   Research Apple Calendar integration.
    *   Develop the unified calendar UI component/widget.
2.  **Task Tracking Feature**:
    *   Refine Firestore schema for `tasks`.
    *   Implement CRUD operations for tasks.
    *   Develop task tracking UI components and integrate into dashboard/project views.
3.  **Document Management (Dropbox Integration)**:
    *   Implement OAuth flow for Dropbox.
    *   Implement backend logic (Cloud Functions) for Dropbox API.
    *   Refine Firestore schema for `documentMetadata`.
    *   Implement frontend service logic (`src/services/dropbox.ts`).
    *   Develop UI components for Dropbox file management.
4.  **Email Integration**:
    *   Implement backend logic for Gmail/Microsoft Graph APIs.
    *   Refine Firestore schema for `emailMetadata`.
    *   Implement frontend service logic (`src/services/`).
    *   Research Apple Mail approach.
    *   Develop unified email client UI components/widget.
5.  **AI Feature Implementation**:
    *   Begin development of AI Quick Search and AI Project Assistant.

## Pending Setup/Actions

*   **Cloud Functions Dependencies**: Ensure `npm install` has been run inside the `/functions` directory.
*   **Deployment**:
    *   Deploy Firestore rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` (Run if rules changed significantly).
    *   Deploy Cloud Functions: Ensure `functions/index.js` exports all functions, then run `firebase deploy --only functions` (Run if functions were added/changed).
*   **Admin SDK Credentials (Local Development)**: Ensure the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable is set correctly when running functions locally via the emulator.
