# CollabFlow Project Status Report

## Global Project Status

Significant progress has been made. The **User Management & Authentication** foundation is complete. The **Project Management Basics** feature set, including Firestore schema, security rules, Cloud Functions for CRUD operations, and frontend hooks/UI, has been implemented. The Unified Workspace Dashboard UI structure is in place, displaying projects and placeholders for future integrations. Estimated completion: ~40%.

## Completed

*   Initial Next.js project structure using TypeScript.
*   Basic Firebase project configuration (`firebase.json`).
*   UI component library setup (using shadcn/ui components found in `src/components/ui`).
*   Basic application layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`).
*   Directory structure and placeholders for AI features and service integrations.
*   Initial documentation (`docs/blueprint.md`).
*   **Firebase Authentication flows (`/src/lib/auth.ts`)**: Implemented setup for Google, Microsoft, Apple sign-in providers, sign-out, `useAuth` hook, and populated with environment variable placeholders. Added cross-platform compatibility notes.
*   **Firestore Schema (`@docs/firestoreSchema.md`)**: Defined schema for `users`, `invites`, and **`projects`** collections. Placeholders remain for tasks and integrations.
*   **Invite-Only System Logic**:
    *   Cloud Function (`/functions/invite.js`) implemented for `createInvite` and `verifyAndAcceptInvite` using **Firebase Admin SDK**.
    *   Cloud Functions dependencies defined in `/functions/package.json` (including `uuid`).
    *   Frontend helper functions (`/src/lib/invite.ts`) for calling invite functions.
*   **Firestore Security Rules (`/firestore.rules`)**: Implemented rules for `users`, `invites`, and **`projects`**, enforcing role-based access (Admin full access, Users access based on project `members` list). Placeholder rules added for related data (tasks, etc.).
*   **Deployment Documentation (`@docs/deployment.md`)**: Updated with instructions for deploying Cloud Functions (`invite.js`, `projects.js`) and Firestore rules using Firebase CLI.
*   **Project Management Basics**:
    *   Cloud Function (`/functions/projects.js`) implemented for `createProject`, `getProjects`, `updateProject`, `deleteProject` with admin restrictions.
    *   Frontend helper functions and hook (`/src/lib/projects.ts`: `createProject`, `updateProject`, `deleteProject`, `useProjects`) created for interacting with project functions.
*   **Unified Workspace Dashboard UI (`/src/components/dashboard.tsx`, `/src/app/page.tsx`)**:
    *   Implemented basic dashboard structure using shadcn/ui components.
    *   Integrated project list using `useProjects` hook with loading (skeleton) and error states.
    *   Included placeholder widgets for Calendar, Tasks, Documents, and Emails.
    *   Applied basic styling from `@blueprint.md` (colors, font).

## In Progress

*   **Refinement of Dashboard UI**: Enhancing widget appearance, responsiveness (`useMobile` hook example added), and subtle animations (`framer-motion` added).
*   **Firestore Triggers (Optional but Recommended)**: Implementing Cloud Firestore triggers to automatically synchronize the `assignedProjects` array in `users` documents when the `members` array in `projects` documents changes. This optimizes user-specific queries.
*   **Error Handling & User Feedback**: Improving user feedback mechanisms for CRUD operations and API calls across the frontend.
*   **Testing**: Adding unit/integration tests for Cloud Functions and frontend components.

## Next Steps

Based on the requirements in `@blueprint.md` and current progress, the next priorities are:

1.  **Calendar Management Integration**:
    *   Implement backend logic (Cloud Functions) for Google Calendar and Microsoft Calendar APIs (OAuth, event fetching/creation).
    *   Implement frontend service logic in `src/services/google-calendar.ts`, `src/services/microsoft-calendar.ts`.
    *   Research and decide on the best approach for Apple Calendar integration (`src/services/apple-calendar.ts`).
    *   Develop the unified calendar UI component/widget for the dashboard, integrating data from the services.
2.  **Task Tracking Feature**:
    *   Refine Firestore schema for `tasks` in `@docs/firestoreSchema.md`.
    *   Implement Cloud Functions or secure client-side logic (with rules) for CRUD operations on tasks (respecting project assignments and roles).
    *   Develop the task tracking UI components (list view, detail view, creation form) and integrate into the dashboard/project views.
3.  **Document Management (Dropbox Integration)**:
    *   Implement OAuth flow for Dropbox authentication.
    *   Implement backend logic (Cloud Functions) for Dropbox API interactions (browsing, linking).
    *   Refine Firestore schema for `documentMetadata` in `@docs/firestoreSchema.md`.
    *   Implement frontend service logic in `src/services/dropbox.ts`.
    *   Develop UI components for browsing and managing Dropbox files within projects/dashboard.
4.  **Email Integration**:
    *   Implement backend logic for Gmail and Microsoft Graph (Outlook) APIs.
    *   Refine Firestore schema for `emailMetadata`.
    *   Implement frontend service logic in `src/services/gmail.ts`, `src/services/microsoft-outlook.ts`.
    *   Research approach for Apple Mail (`src/services/apple-mail.ts`).
    *   Develop the unified email client UI components/widget.
5.  **AI Feature Implementation**:
    *   Begin development of AI Quick Search and AI Project Assistant based on flows in `src/ai/flows/`.

## Pending Setup/Actions

*   **Firebase Configuration**: Populate the `.env.local` file (or your deployment environment variables) with your actual Firebase project configuration values (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`).
*   **Cloud Functions Dependencies**: Run `npm install` inside the `/functions` directory.
*   **Deployment**:
    *   Deploy Firestore rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
    *   Deploy Cloud Functions: Create/update `functions/index.js` to export all functions (`invite`, `projects`), then run `firebase deploy --only functions`. Refer to `docs/deployment.md`.
*   **Admin SDK Credentials (Local Development)**: Ensure the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable is set correctly when running functions locally (e.g., via the emulator) for the Admin SDK to authenticate.
